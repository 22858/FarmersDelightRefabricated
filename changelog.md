- Prefixed all recipe book related enums.
- Fixed vectorwing not being present within the mod credits.
- Fixed Dog Food not applying any superclass tooltips.
- Added a barebones compat layer just for Fright's Delight and Delight Knives.
  - Feel free to ask for more compat layers, we'll do it if it seems do-able and simplistic enough, just please accept no as an answer if we say so.
