The tags within the `c` namespace within the `src/main/resources/data` directory are tags for Farmer's Delight Fabric backwards compatibility or otherwise general backwards compatibility.

These will be removed when Farmer's Delight Refabricated updates to 1.20.6, so please look into the new conventional tag format as soon as that happens.
